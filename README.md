## Publications
- **Ceramic Fiber Interconnects Beyond 1000° C Enabled by Automatic Gain Compensated Millimeter-Wave CMOS Transceivers**  
  *Abhishek Sharma, Christopher Kniss, Ratanak Phon, Rod Kim*  
  2025 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS), pp. 1–5  
  Publisher: IEEE  
  **Status:** Published — May 25, 2025  

  **Summary:**  
  - Investigates hollow-core ceramic (alumina) fiber for millimeter-wave communications at temperatures up to 1100 °C.  
  - Measured EM wave propagation through alumina fiber across 50–75 GHz range at high temperatures.  
  - Found transmission magnitude decreases non-linearly with temperature but remains stable (<0.5 dB variation) after one hour at 1100 °C.  
  - Paired fiber with a 57 GHz CMOS transceiver to demonstrate a high-speed communication link at high temperatures.  
  - Implemented automatic gain control loop in the receiver chain to compensate for temperature-related transmission variations.  
  - Achieved a **data rate of 5 Gb/s** at extreme operating conditions.  

  **Applications:** Aerospace, avionics, geothermal systems, and other extreme environment electronics.
